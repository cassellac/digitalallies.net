Short description
Digital Allies — a small static website that helps build digital confidence, foster community, and encourage exploration. The site is composed of standalone HTML pages and static assets; there is no backend or build step.

Quick start
- Open index.html in a browser to preview locally (no server required).
- Edit HTML files directly to update content.

Key files and folders
- index.html — main entry point
- digital_allies_website.html, ada_guide.html, visual_brand_mockups.html — additional pages and references
- assets/ — images and branding assets (use PNG for logos and favicon)
- .github/ — repository metadata and guidance

Project conventions
- Static-only: no package manager, no build, and no server code.
- File naming: descriptive HTML filenames (e.g., ada_guide.html).
- Branding: use assets/logo_horizontal_primary.png for primary branding.
- Accessibility: follow patterns and guidance in ada_guide.html.

How to contribute
- Edit the HTML files directly to change content or structure.
- Add new images to assets/ and reference them with relative paths.
- If you add a new page, link it from index.html and other relevant pages.
- For questions or proposals, open an issue or contact the maintainers.

Notes
- Keep accessibility and consistent branding top of mind when adding content.
- This repository serves static content only; changes are live when pushed and deployed by the site host.
